# üö¢ Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Analysis and Prediction** project!  
This project explores and models the survival of Titanic passengers using a real-world dataset, demonstrating data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling skills.

## üß† Project Objective

The goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models. This notebook showcases:

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Visualization of patterns
- Building and evaluating classification models

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is from [Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/). It includes features such as:

- Passenger ID, Name, Age, Sex  
- Pclass (Ticket Class)  
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)  
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)  
- Fare, Cabin, Embarked (Port of Embarkation)  
- Survival status (target variable)

---

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## üìå Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, converted categorical features, and removed irrelevant columns.  
- **EDA:** Visualized survival rates based on gender, age groups, and more.  
- **Modeling:** Trained Decision Trees for this problem.
- **Evaluation:** Used scores for checking accuracy.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

The **Dicision Tree Classifier** performed best among the models tested, showing good accuracy on the validation data and making meaningful predictions on the train set.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize models further.  
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Extract more meaningful features from `Name`, `Cabin`, and `Ticket`.  
- ‚úÖ **Cross-validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation for more reliable evaluation.  
- ‚úÖ **Ensemble Methods:** Try boosting techniques like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost.  
- ‚úÖ **UI Web App:** Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for live user predictions.
